# DataBase-in-File

This Java code manages a database of hospitals using a file stored in the root folder of the project. The file stores the following information for each hospital: code (4 bytes), name (40 bytes), specialty (4 bytes), and number of employees (4 bytes). The specialty is represented as a number, which represents an internal code to identify the specialty (e.g. psychiatry, rheumatology, etc.). The code provides functionality to add new hospitals to the database, and to get the last code used in the database. It also has a menu function to display options to the user.
